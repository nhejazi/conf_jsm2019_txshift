  \item The HIV-1 epidemic --- the facts:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item now in its fourth decade,
      \item 2.5 million new infections occurring annually worldwide,
      \item new infections outpace patients starting antiretroviral therapy.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textit{Most efficacious} preventive vaccine: 31\% reduction rate.
  \item \textbf{Question}: How can HIV-1 vaccines be improved by modulating
    immunogenic CD4+ or CD8+ response profiles?

  \item Immunogenic response profile only available for second-stage sample of
    $n = 189$ \citep{janes2017higher}.
  \item \underline{Two-phased sampling mechanism:} 100\% inclusion rate if
    HIV-1 positive in week 28; variable otherwise.
  \item \textbf{Question:} How would HIV-1 infection risk in week 28 have
    differed had immunogenic response (due to vaccine) differed?
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep10pt
  \item Baseline covariates($W$): sex, age, BMI, behavioral HIV risk.
  \item Intervention(s) ($A$): post-vaccination T-cell activity markers.
  \item Outcome ($Y$): HIV-1 infection status at week 28 of tiral.
  \item \textbf{Conclusion:} Understanding which immune responses impact vaccine
    efficacy helps develop more efficacious vaccines.
  \item A vaccine effective at preventing HIV-1 acquisition would be a
    cost-effective and durable approach to halting the worldwide epidemic.
  \item Identifying vaccine-induced immune-response biomarkers that predict a
    vaccine's ability to protect individuals from HIV-1 infection is a high
    priority.
  \item The study was halted on 22 April 2013 due to absence of vaccine
    efficacy. There was no significant effect of the vaccine on the primary
    infection endpoint of HIV-1 infection between week 28 and month 24.

    interventions?
     \begin{equation*}\label{shift_intervention}
       d(a, w) =

  \item \cite{diaz2012population, diaz2018stochastic} give a statistical target
    parameter and influence function for the complete data case.

    estimation. Nonparametric options?

\note{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For HVTN 505, $\psi_{0,d}$ is the counterfactual risk of HIV-1
      infection, had the observed value of the immune response been modifed to
      originate from the distribution of the rule $d(A,W)$.
    \item Several different ways to consider stochastic interventions.
    \item Starts with Mark and Ivan's simple stochastic shift.
    \item Extensions to modified treatment policies.
    \item The new value of $A$ may be denoted $A^{\star} \sim

\begin{frame}[c]{Stochastic Interventions in our NPSEM}

\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep8pt
  \item \textit{Stochastic interventions} modify the value $A$ would naturally
    assume, $f_A(W, U_A)$, by drawing from a modified intervention distribution
    $G^*(\cdot \mid W)$ so that the new value $A^* \sim G^*(\cdot \mid W)$.
  \item This generates a counterfactual RV, with distribution $P_{0}^d$,
    $Y_{d(A, W)} \coloneqq f_Y(d(A,W), W, U_Y) \equiv Y_{G^*} \coloneqq
    f_Y(A^*, W, U_Y)$.
  \item We estimate $\psi_{0, d} \coloneqq \E_{P_0^d}\{Y_{d(A,W)}\}$, mean of
    $Y_{d(A, W)}$.
  \item For HVTN 505, $\psi_{0,d}$ is the counterfactual risk of HIV-1
    infection, had the observed value of the immune response been altered under
    the rule $d(A,W)$ defining $G^*(\cdot \mid W)$.
  \item Helps isolate immune responses that causally inhibit HIV-1; future
    vaccines may be designed to target these markers.

  \item \textit{Proposal:} Evaluate outcome under an altered
    \textit{intervention distribution} --- e.g.,
    $P_{\delta}(g_0)(A = a \mid W) = g_0(a - \delta(W) \mid W)$.
  \item Identification conditions for a statistical parameter of the
    counterfactual outcome $\psi_{0,d}$ under such an intervention.
  \item Show that the causal quantity of interest $\E_0 \{Y_{d(A, W)}\}$ is
    identified by a functional of the distribution of $X$:
    \begin{align*}\label{eqn:identification2012}
      \psi_{0,d} = \int_{\mathcal{W}} \int_{\mathcal{A}} &\E_{P_0^X} \{Y \mid
        A = d(a, w), W = w\} \cdot \\ &q_{0, A}^X(a \mid W = w) \cdot
        q_{0, W}^X(w) d\mu(a)d\nu(w)
    \end{align*}
  \item Provides a derivation based on the efficient influence function (EIF)
    with respect to the nonparametric model $\mathcal{M}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{center}

\note{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The identification result allows us to write down the causal quantity
      of interest in terms of a functional of the observed data.
    \item Key innovation: loosening standard assumptions through a change in
      the observed intervention mechanism.
    \item Problem: globally altering an intervention mechanism does not
      necessarily respect individual characteristics.
    \item The authors build IPW, A-IPW, and TML estimators, comparing the three
      different approaches.
    \item IMPORTANT: gives the g-computation formula for identification of this
      estimator from the observed data structure.

    proposed after their earlier work.
  \item To protect against positivity violations, considers a specific shifting
    mechanism:
     \begin{equation*}\label{shift_intervention}
       d(a, w) =
         \begin{cases}

           a, & \text{otherwise}

    covariate for constructing the TML estimator.

  \item Uniquely, a multiple robustness property emerges --- through
    combinations of $(g, Q)$ and $(\pi(Y, W), \E(D^F(P^X_0)(x) \mid Y, W))$.

\begin{frame}[c]{Nonparametric Conditional Density Estimation}

\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep8pt
  \item To compute the auxiliary covariate $H(a,w)$, we need to estimate
    conditional densities $g(A \mid W)$ and $g(A - \delta \mid W)$.
  \item There is a rich literature on density estimation, we follow the approach
    proposed in \cite{diaz2011super}.
  \item To build a conditional density estimator, consider
    \begin{equation*}
      g_{n, \alpha}(a \mid W) = \frac{\pr (A \in [\alpha_{t-1}, \alpha_t)
        \mid W)}{\alpha_t - \alpha_{t-1}},
    \end{equation*}
    for $\alpha_{t-1} \leq a < \alpha_t$.
    \vspace{0.5em}
    \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep4pt
      \item This is a classification problem, where we estimate the probability
        that a value of $A$ falls in a bin $[\alpha_{t-1}, \alpha_t)$.
      \item The choice of the tuning parameter $t$ corresponds roughly to the
        choice of bandwidth in classical kernel density estimation.

\begin{frame}[c]{Nonparametric Conditional Density Estimation}

\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep8pt
  \item \cite{diaz2011super} propose a re-formulation of this classification
    approach as a set of hazard regressions.
  \item To effectively employ this proposed re-formulation, consider
    \begin{align*}
      \pr (A \in [\alpha_{t-1}, \alpha_t) \mid W) =& \pr (A \in [\alpha_{t-1},
      \alpha_t) \mid A \geq \alpha_{t-1}, W) \times  \\ & \Pi_{j = 1}^{t -1}
      \{1 - \pr (A \in [\alpha_{j-1}, \alpha_j) \mid A \geq \alpha_{j-1}, W) \}
    \end{align*}
    \vspace{0.25em}
    \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep4pt
      \item The likelihood of this model may be expressed to correspond to the
        likelihood of a binary variable in a data set expressed via a long-form
        repeated measures structure.
      \item Specifically, the observation of $X_i$ is repeated as many times as
        intervals $[\alpha_{t-1}, \alpha_t)$ are before the interval to which
        $A_i$ belongs, and the binary variables indicating $A_i \in
        [\alpha_{t-1}, \alpha_t)$ are recorded.

\begin{frame}[c]{Density Estimation with the Super Learner Algorithm}

\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep10pt
  \item To estimate $g(A \mid W$) and $g(A - \delta \mid W)$, use a pooled
    hazard regression, spanning the support of $A$.
  \item We rely on the Super Learner algorithm of \cite{vdl2007super} to build
    an ensemble learner that optimally weights each of the proposed regressions,
    using cross-validation (CV).
  \item The Super Learner algorithm uses $V$-fold CV to train each proposed
    regression model, weighting each by the inverse of its average risk across
    all $V$ holdout sets.
  \item By using a library of regression estimators, we invoke the result of
    \cite{vdl2004asymptotic}, who prove this likelihood-based cross-validated
    estimator to be asymptotically optimal.
\end{itemize}
\end{center}

\note{
\begin{itemize}
  \item The auxiliary covariate simplifies when the treatment is in the limits
    (conditional on $W$) --- i.e., for $A_i \in (u(w) - \delta, u(w))$, then we
    have $H(a,w) = \frac{g_0(a - \delta \mid w)}{g_0(a \mid w)} + 1$.
  \item Asymptotically optimal in the sense that it performs as well as the
    oracle selector as the sample size increases.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[c]{Algorithm for IPCW-TML Estimation}

\begin{center}
\begin{enumerate}\label{ipcwtmle_algo}
  \itemsep8pt
  \item Using all observed units ($X$), estimate sampling mechanism
    $\pi(Y, W)$, perhaps using data-adaptive regression methods.
  \item Using only observed units in the second-stage sample $\Delta = 1$,
    construct initial estimators $g_n(A, W)$ and $\overline{Q}_n(A, W)$,
    weighting by the sampling mechanism estimate $\pi_n(Y, W)$.
  \item With the approach described for the full data case, compute
    $H_n(a_i,w_i)$, and fluctuate submodel via logistic regression.
  \item Compute IPCW-TML estimator $\Psi_n$ of the target parameter, by solving
    the IPCW-augmented EIF estimating equation.
  \item Iteratively update estimated sampling weights $\pi_n(Y,W)$ and
    IPCW-augmented EIF, updating TML estimate in each iteration, until
    $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n \text{EIF}_i < \frac{1}{n}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{center}

\note{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We recommend using nonparametric methods for the initial estimators,
      as consistent estimation is necessary for efficiency of the estimator
      $\Psi_n$.
    \item Intuition for the submodel fluctuation?
    \item This process includes the use of HAL to fit the regression of the EIF
      contributions on the sampling node $\{Y, W\}$.
